## Gameplay Overview

Drunken Sailors is a 2-player local co-op game where communication and timing are everything.

- Each player independently chooses a direction during a short planning window
- On the downbeat of the background music, both inputs execute simultaneously
- The ship moves based on the combined direction:
  - Same direction: move faster
  - Perpendicular directions: move diagonally
  - Opposing directions: stop entirely
- Score is based on how long you survive the rocky seas

The result is a fast-paced cooperative experience that rewards teamwork and punishes miscommunication.
